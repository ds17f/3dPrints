# Prints
## Print 1: Prototype
For the first print I choses a `0.3 mm` layer height just to get it printed quickly.  I wanted to see how the parts fit together
This worked but as is mentioned in the comments on thingiverse the default size is too small for credit cards.


## Print 2: 
The comments on thingiverse mention printing at 101%, so I scaled up the print.  In addition I set the layer height at 0.15mm 
hoping to get a finer print.

The wallet came out great, and all the parts fit together well, but unfortunately the print stuck to the printer bed and
I ripped a part of the bed when removing the wallet.
